            “I was nicknamed Frenchie as much for my name as for my people—the Metis. 
            I came from a long line of hunters, trappers, and voyageurs. But now, with 
            most of the rivers cut into pieces and lakes left as grey sludge puckers on 
            the landscape, my own history seemed like a myth along the lines of dragons.” 
            (Dimaline 24)

            "He'd lost someone he'd built a life with right in the middle of that life. 
            Suddenly, I realized that there was something worse than running, worse even 
            than the schools. There was loss" (Dimaline 99).

              When I first chose The Marrow Thieves as my INS novel, I thought that the book would just be another history trip back to treaties and residential schools using a modern medium such as a dystopian novel but as I read through the entire book, I realized I had judged too quickly. The Marrow Thieves by Cherie Dimaline, taught me a lot about resilience and family. Throughout the novel, French and the family face the constant threat of being hunted for their bone marrow. Despite these harsh realities, they still manage to be resilient and adapt to their circumstances. Although not blood-related, Miig’s “family” are still able to find strength in their shared experiences and support one another in their pursuit of survival and freedom while many others facing the same situation would treat it like saying “Everyone for themselves.” This is evident when we see French kill Travis in a fit of rage over the brutal death of RiRi, a seven-year-old girl that has been travelling with Miig’s family, that flashed right in front of his eyes. French repeatedly mentions hearing people around him try to reason as he “cocked the barrel and trained it” on Travis. He swiftly dismisses these actions by simply blaming it as “just the wind” (Dimaline 122). As “Panic flashed” across Travis’ face, it quickly “settled into a look of soft, practiced pleading” which was the only time that French “felt anger through it all, seeing that rehearsed mask slip over his dark face” (Dimaline 122). This reminds me that not all family has to be bound by blood. Family can be formed through deep connections, shared experiences, and trust. This also reminds us that family can be found in the places we least expect and that the actions we receive from these people can be just as meaningful as that of our biological families.
