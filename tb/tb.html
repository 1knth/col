             The Boy in the Picture is an Indigenous boy named Thomas Moore Keesick. This podcast sheds light on the destructive nature of the industrial school system. His photographs were used in the Department of Indian Affairs report, which was titled "Before and After," showcasing the effects an Industrial institution would have on the Indigenous youth and how it could assimilate them into society. The podcasts mention that Thomas was actually used and posted a year after he died. The department had no knowledge about his death and didn't do any research prior to using a deceased boy's photo for monetary gain. This really shows how ignorant and exploitative the government was back in the 80s. They were greedy and used any propaganda they could get ahold of regardless of the ethical value. I was shocked when I heard it was admitted that the “goal of settler colonialization was to eventually eliminate the Indigenous population physically and culturally through assimilation into the settler population” (8:36). This again conveyed how little remorse and tolerance because they were able to acknowledge their wrongdoing and still seem to have the stomach to go through with it. What spoke to me the most is my self-reflection after listening to the podcast. It left me wondering about the victims that weren’t lucky enough to have been broadcasted, the ones that were forced to attend but weren’t recognized, the ones whose stories could’ve changed the world, or rather lack of. I remember seeing a video on TikTok where the creator used the analogy “No one cares if one grain of sand is missing from the beach.” They were talking about the themes of suicide and how one death in eight billion wouldn’t be heard but, if you took some time and give it some thought, everyone on Earth is different and there is only one version of yourself which makes you stand out from the rest of the grains of sand. This really captivates the power of a single story and the fact that there are victims of industrial and residential schools who still remain either unlocated or unidentified is very disheartening and should be a wake-up call to the Western world that it needs to take more responsibility in their horrible past.
