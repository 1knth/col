            My exploration of various sources on identity, self-reflection, reconciliation, and communication has made me learn about myself and these concepts more. Each reflection brought unique insights that expanded my view on life. Initially, when I chose "The Marrow Thieves" as my novel, I expected a typical exploration of history through a dystopian lens. However, as I delved deeper into the book, I discovered its powerful lessons on resilience and the strength found in chosen families. French and his "family" faced constant threats, yet they remained resilient, adapting to their circumstances. Their bond, forged through shared experiences and unwavering support, shattered my previous notion that family is solely defined by blood. It taught me that compassion and solidarity can transcend traditional boundaries. In the documentary "Cottagers & Indians," the deliberate use of the word "and" instead of "versus" challenged my understanding of relationships between communities. It emphasized the importance of collaboration, shared responsibility, and reconciliation. By recognizing the need to bridge divides, we can mutually understand one another and work towards a more inclusive society. Reflecting on my own writing process, I initially considered fabricating a story to impress others. However, I chose authenticity instead, sharing a personal conflict I had genuinely experienced. This act of vulnerability allowed me to embrace my own growth and connect with others on a deeper level. It taught me that there is power in acknowledging our vulnerabilities and that the strength of our stories lies in their truthfulness.The podcast about "The Boy in the Picture ''  both disturbed and intrigued me, exposing the government's exploitative manner and ignorance. Using Thomas Moore Keesick's photograph without knowledge of his death demonstrated the callousness and disregard for Indigenous lives. It made me question the countless other untold stories and the urgent need to seek justice for those whose voices have been silenced. Rita Joe's poem, "I Lost My Talk," urged us to reclaim our unique stories and identities in the face of societal pressure. Her gentle advocacy and willingness to educate others shattered the misconception that kindness towards those who wronged us equates to weakness. She exemplified the resilience and empowerment that comes from preserving one's culture and reclaiming one's voice. Rebecca Thomas's TED Talk on "Etuaptmumk: Two-Eyed Seeing" provided a fresh perspective on integrating Indigenous knowledge with Western science. Embracing multiple viewpoints allows for a deeper understanding of complex issues. The concept of seeing through both lenses simultaneously, or Etuaptmumk, emphasizes the value of diverse perspectives, collaborative coexistence, and the celebration of cultural traditions. Collectively, these reflections have reshaped my understanding of identity, self-reflection, reconciliation, and communication. They have taught me the importance of authenticity, vulnerability, and empathy in personal growth and fostering understanding between communities. I am inspired to speak up, challenge oppressive narratives, and actively pursue a better and more inclusive world. These lessons will help me as I navigate through my life far beyond this course and will be something that I actively use everyday from today forward.

            My symbol is Indigenous woven tapestry. The threads in the tapestry symbolize the various reflections and sources encountered throughout the exploration, each offering unique insights and adding depth to our understanding. The colors represent the vibrant diversity of voices and narratives that contribute to our collective knowledge. The tapestry also represents the interconnectedness of these concepts. Just as the threads are tightly interwoven, identity, self-reflection, reconciliation, and communication are interconnected and influence one another. They cannot be understood in isolation but rather as interdependent elements that shape our personal growth and our interactions with others. Furthermore, the tapestry serves as a reminder of the complexity and beauty that emerges when different perspectives and experiences come together. It highlights the value of inclusivity, collaboration, and embracing diversity in our quest for understanding and connection.
