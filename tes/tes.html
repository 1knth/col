            “Peoplehood is made up of four things territory, sacred history, ceremonial cycle 
            and language. Each thread informs the other, you can’t address a single aspect of 
            it without looking at the whole” (Thomas 3:55).

            “Two-eyed seeing, takes the strengths of both a colonized world and both an indigenous 
            and asks that the user see through both lenses simultaneously to find success. It is 
            the Mi'kmaq understanding of the gift of multiple perspectives” (8:39).

              Rebecca Thomas's TED Talk on "Etuaptmumk: Two-Eyed Seeing" offers a thought-provoking exploration of Indigenous knowledge and its combined use with Western science. Throughout her presentation, Thomas emphasizes the importance of embracing multiple perspectives and understanding the connection between all living things. In her Ted talk, Thomas shares personal stories and experiences deeply-rooted in her Mi'kmaw heritage, highlighting the wisdom and understanding embedded within Indigenous ways of 
              “knowing”. She challenges the dominant Western perspective that often dismisses and devalues Indigenous knowledge systems by emphasizing the need for a more inclusive approach to learning and problem-solving. She introduces the Elder Albert Marshall’s idea of Etuaptmumk. This is the practice of seeing “through both lenses simultaneously." Rebecca mentions that the concept of Etuaptmumk, “takes the strengths of both a colonized world and an indigenous world” which help the user find success.” By embracing multiple perspectives, individuals can attain a deeper understanding and navigate complex issues more effectively. The quote highlights the importance of recognizing the wisdom and insights offered by different cultural perspectives. Two-eyed seeing invites individuals to exceed the limitations of a single worldview and appreciate the richness that comes from blending multiple lenses. By using this approach, people can foster mutual learning, empathy, and collaboration, which all in all leads to success in addressing challenges and creating a more inclusive society. Later, Rebecca talks about peoplehood. She mentions that peoplehood is made up of four things, “territory, sacred history, ceremonial cycle, and language." She encapsulates the interdependence of these elements. Territory shapes identity and connections to the land, while sacred history encompasses ancestral narratives and cultural foundations. The ceremonial cycle preserves traditions, communal bonds, and language which carries cultural nuances and generations of wisdom.  Overall, Rebecca Thomas's TED Talk on Two-eyed seeing leaves me with a better understanding regarding the power of embracing multiple perspectives. It challenges the western world to question our own biases, broaden our worldview, and actively engage in building a more inclusive and harmonious society. By adopting the principles of Two-eyed seeing, I can contribute to a better society that celebrates diversity, values cultural heritage, and promotes a deeper sense of understanding and connection among all people.
