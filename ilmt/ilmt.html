              In the modern world, we often see a struggle in finding one’s 
              voice. Self-expression has become uncommon because our society 
              constantly tries to diminish individual identities. This problem 
              is addressed in “I Lost My Talk” by Rita Joe when she says “I 
              speak like you, I think like you, I create like you” (Joe 7-8). 
              Throughout the poem, she urges us to embrace our unique stories 
              and reclaim our power to be heard. Joe sheds light on the loss of 
              identity and cultural heritage endured in her community. The poem 
              acts as a joint-effort cry for reclamation in the face of today's 
              society. Her poem not only inspires Indigenous communities to speak
              out for themselves but has also reminded me of my knowledge regarding 
              the painful consequences of colonization and the removal of culture 
              like the ongoing xenophobia happening in America where my family 
              resides. Joe challenges the notion of a singular narrative or perspective 
              and encourages a more inclusive understanding of the diverse history 
              and experiences faced by Indigenous people. I often thought for many 
              years of my life that showing kindness to people that have wronged 
              you makes you weak but, despite the ignorance of the Western world, 
              Joe is patient, she “gently” advocates and  “offers her hand” to 
              educate those who are willing to listen (Joe 13-15). She sets an 
              example for her community and promotes a passive solution to this 
              generational conflict by symbolizing that you can’t fight fire with 
              fire. She taught me that being the bigger person in any situation would 
              never have any consequences even if things don’t go as planned.
