              When I initially heard about this assignment, I found myself grappling with the idea of making up a fabricated story in order to sound more impressive and strong. However, as the days passed without any inspiration, I made the conscious decision to talk about a personal conflict I had genuinely experienced. This was a moment of vulnerability for me where I allowed myself to be open and truthful in my writing. Admittedly, when I shared my work with friends to get it proofread, I maintained the lie that it was purely just a fabricated story and assured them I was doing well. This was because I was hesitant to expose the emotions that lay beneath the words I wrote. Now that I’m reflecting on this, I realize that there really was no shame in sharing my authentic experiences. By choosing now to write a reflection on this, I am embracing the reality of my struggles and challenges. I acknowledge that life is not always seamless but rather one filled with moments of hardships and growth. As I go through the layers of my story, I start revealing to myself the strength that lies in my own vulnerability. This serves as a reminder to myself that no one is ever alone in their struggles. I have come to realize that the true value of this journey is embracing the authenticity of myself which has changed the way I approach life as a whole. I refuse to be embarrassed or ashamed of the challenges I have faced. Instead, I choose to embrace them as an important reminder of helping me shape the person I am today. These experiences which encompass both triumph and tribulation.
